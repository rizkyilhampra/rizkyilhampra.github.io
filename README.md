## üéµ Spotify Integration

This site fetches Spotify top tracks/artists to `public/spotify.json` via a scheduled GitHub Action.

Setup (GitHub repository settings):

1. Create a Spotify App at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and note the Client ID/Secret.
2. Generate a Refresh Token with scope: `user-top-read`.
   - You can use any OAuth helper locally to perform the Authorization Code flow.
3. Add GitHub Secrets:
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`
4. The workflow `.github/workflows/update-spotify.yml` runs daily and commits `public/spotify.json` when changed.

Notes:
- Only medium_term (approx last 6 months) top tracks and artists are fetched.
- No now playing or recently played is used.
