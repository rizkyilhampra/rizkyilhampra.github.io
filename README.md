## ‚å®Ô∏è Monkeytype Integration

- Overview: The site can display your Monkeytype stats without exposing your API key by fetching data during CI and committing a `monkeytype.json` file that the frontend reads at runtime.

- Security: Never commit your API key. Store it as a GitHub Repository Secret named `MONKEYTYPE_API_KEY`.

### 1) Enable the workflow

The repo includes `.github/workflows/update-monkeytype.yml` which runs every 12 hours or on demand. It executes `scripts/fetch-monkeytype.mjs` to write `monkeytype.json` at the repo root and commits it.

Steps:

1. Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret.
2. Name: `MONKEYTYPE_API_KEY`. Value: your Monkeytype API key.
3. (Optional) Update username: The workflow uses `MONKEYTYPE_USERNAME` and currently defaults to `rizkyilhampra`.
4. Manually run the workflow from Actions tab (or wait for the schedule).

The script uses the official MonkeyType API endpoints per the docs at https://api.monkeytype.com/docs

API endpoint mapping:
- Profile: `GET /users/{uidOrName}/profile` (ApeKey auth)
- Personal bests: `GET /users/personalBests` (ApeKey auth)
- Recent results: `GET /results` (ApeKey auth, returns up to 1000 recent results)

Normalize responses into this shape (example in `monkeytype.sample.json`):

```
{
  "profile": { "name": "...", "id": "..." },
  "summary": { "tests": 0, "timeTyping": 0 },
  "pbs": {
    "time15": { "wpm": 0, "acc": 0.0, "timestamp": "" },
    "time60": { "wpm": 0, "acc": 0.0, "timestamp": "" }
  },
  "recent": [ { "wpm": 0, "acc": 0.0, "mode": "time", "time": 60, "language": "english", "timestamp": "" } ]
}
```

The frontend component (`src/MonkeytypeStats.jsx`) fetches `/monkeytype.json` and renders:
- Best 60s and 15s WPM (+ accuracy)
- Average WPM/accuracy across recent results
- Total tests + time typing
- A tiny sparkline from recent WPMs

If `monkeytype.json` is missing, the UI shows a small ‚ÄúConnect Monkeytype‚Äù card.
